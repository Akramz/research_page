Enhancing the accuracy of S2S extreme forecasts can lead to profound societal benefits, such as improved disaster response and early warnings for disease outbreaks and heatwaves. In our research, we pinpoint ECMWF-based weather indices that offer a significant predictive advantage over standard climatology. The correlation between these ECMWF indices and actual measurements is explored. These indices can be derived either directly from daily forecasts or via specialized ML-models in a multi-task learning framework. Our primary aim is to refine the communication of S2S climate risks using a tailored suite of ECMWF-derived forecast tools.
