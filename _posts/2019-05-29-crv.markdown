Traditional agricultural practices face increasing risks due to the changing climate and more frequent extreme events, making traditional food production forecasts unreliable. We introduce a methodology that merges seasonal weather predictions, geo-spatial data from remote sensing, extreme event risks, and crop growth models to assess regional production risks. This approach was successfully validated across multiple seasons in several Iowa counties.
