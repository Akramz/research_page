Satellite imagery and remote sensing data often contain gaps from natural atmospheric disturbances, hampering its utility in supervised and self-supervised learning contextsâ€”a barrier to capitalizing on this invaluable resource in data-driven workflows. To tackle this, we introduce a generative adversarial network (GAN) model capable of simulating realistic atmospheric noise. This model serves as a data augmentation tool, generating augmented datasets that enhance the efficacy of supervised machine learning algorithms.
