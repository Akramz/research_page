We present a deep neural network architecture and use it in time series weather prediction. It stacks multi-LSTMs to map sequences of weather values of the same length. The final goal is to produce two types of models per city (for 9 cities in Morocco) to forecast 24 and 72 hours worth of weather data (for Temperature, Humidity and Wind Speed). Approximately 15 years (2000-2015) of hourly meteorological data was used to train the model. The results show that LSTM based neural networks are competitive with the traditional methods and can be considered a better alternative to forecast general weather conditions.
