With increasing extreme weather events, there's a pressing need for enhanced subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) weather forecasting. Addressing the disparity between numerical weather prediction and seasonal forecasting, we introduce a daily probabilistic forecast model predicting global 2-meter temperature and precipitation. This integrates multimodal data into feature vectors for three ML models: Extreme Gradient Boosting, U-Net, and Natural Gradient Boosting, optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter search. Our approach surpasses the ECMWF 46-day forecasts and climatology, demonstrating that blending physics-based forecasts with diverse predictability sources enhances model efficacy. This enhancement is hoped to refine forecasts of climate extremes, with subsequent models potentially assessing extreme event probabilities more adeptly.
