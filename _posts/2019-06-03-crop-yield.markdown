Analyzing the correlation between climate extremes and decreased regional crop yields, we utilized Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to assess the effects of multiple extreme weather types on corn yields in the USA. Our initial results highlight that events like droughts, floods, and heatwaves significantly influence corn yields across different US regions. This enhanced knowledge of climate extremes' influence on food production is vital, especially as the global frequency of such events is anticipated to increase with climate change.
